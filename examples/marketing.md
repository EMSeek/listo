## Listo Announcement Message

Starting a new project or product? Making a significant change to an existing feature? Want to find out the latest security, reliability and architecture requirements to consider? Why not give Listo a go!

The average time to complete a #listo assessment is 10 minutes that results in a Trello board containing cards specific to your project to triage and prioritise at your leisure.

We are very eager to help teams through the #listo process and collect any feedback from your experience :) The RFC can be found [here](rfc_listo.md).
