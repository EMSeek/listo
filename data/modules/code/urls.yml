minimumRisk: Medium Risk
checkLists:
  General:
  - question: We are using a well supported url library to load and verify every url before operating on it.
  - question: >
      We have looked into ways to avoid directing users to arbitrary urls, especially
      those that are user-controlled (Open Redirect).
  - question: >
      We know what type of scheme (http/https/ftp) we are expecting, so we are guaranteeing
      that the scheme is being parsed, and validated correctly.
  SSRF:
  - question: We have configured a whitelist of resources or systems (i.e. URL's, files, etc) to which the server can send requests or load data/files from.
