  - question: >
      We have ensured that difference user roles (regular, admin, etc)
      can only access what is intended.
  - question: >
      We have checked that customers can only access data that is intended for them and
      have checked our code for [IDOR](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) vulnerabilities.
