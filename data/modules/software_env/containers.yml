minimumRisk: Low Risk
checkLists:
  AWS ECR:
  - question: We are storing our images within ECR as per the [RFC004 - AWS ECR]()
    tools:
      - Gantry
  - question: We have scanned our currently deployed images for vulnerabilities via [Micro Scanner](https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner).
  - question: We have triaged and created a remediation plan for all high vulnerabilities identified within Micro Scanner.
  General:
  - question: We use a minimal Docker image for our containers to reduce the attack surface (e.g. Alpine vs Ubuntu).
  - question: We have reduced the attack surface further by installing only the packages we need or have considered [Distroless Docker Images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
  - question: We have run [Docker Bench for Security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) to scan for and harden our containers.
