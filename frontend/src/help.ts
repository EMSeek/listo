export const riskHelp = `The risk assessment is designed to help product and enablement teams become aware of the risks their project has on the business. For example processing, accessing or storing sensitive customer PII data will have a bigger risk if that personal information was breached due to a vulnerability within the product.
<br />
<br />
“High Risk” projects have significant impact to the business (e.g. service was unavailable, a vulnerability was found or the project is strategically important to business success). Enablement teams will likely need to get involved or prioritise projects rated as "High Risk". 
<br />
<br />
“Medium Risk” projects will require some engagement but this would be in an ad-hoc capacity.
<br />
<br />
“Low Risk” projects will generally not require much engagement from enablement teams.`;
